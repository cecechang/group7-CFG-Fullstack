# Group 7 full-stack group
### What is the concept?
We want to build a website that will allow dog owners to create a user profile on our site and depending on what breed/preferences they have selected, our site will show tailored information to them. 
The user signs-up, inputs their preferences and will be allowed to use our LocationAPI to display information based on their sign-up information. E.g. Large breed users will be shown walking routes of 2km+ 

### Who will this help? Who is your target audience?
The target audience will be mainly dog owners who are looking for recommendations based on their specific breed of dog (using LocationAPI) and to understand their breeds needs better. 

It could help in scenarios where a new dog owner has moved into the area and is searching for walking routes that fit their specific needs. 
Another scenario is a new dog parent looking to train their puppy and will need to develop their social skills around other dogs.

### How will you be working? What tools will help with that?
Our team will be working in short sprint cycles, with constant communication of new changes being stated in our work chat on slack. Additionally meetings will be made whenever any new idea or change is introduced. This allows all team members to be well established with all progress made on the app. 
We will make use of the paired programme technique, this enables us to work efficiently and learn together in a collaborative setting. Furthermore, the workload of the entire app will be split equally depending on each team member's wants and needs. 
 We will make use of the following tools to help us progress through our work:
Jira
Slack
Figma
VScode
React
Node.JS
MYSQL Workbench
Google drive
Trello

### How will you be organising the workload? Who does what and when?
We have created a roadmap (seen on figma: https://www.figma.com/file/eJMM61TC07tVzUr0sEWPKW/User-flow%2Froadmap%2Fplan?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1)
We have organised the workload split depending on an individual members want to learn more about a specific feature to be implemented. E.g. Working on the Location feature to learn and practise more using APIs. 
As seen on the roadmap, the entire app's progress is shown in phases. Every member has been assigned work to do in every phase as agreed upon in our zoom meetings beforehand.
